      How The 3 Story Keys Became The <span class="text-accent underline">Story-Key™</span> Method
    </h2>
    <div class="text-2xl mb-20 px-10">
      <p class="mb-2">
        When I discovered Stories were the Key, I began experimenting with
        hundreds of different Story-Based Activities. Then I tested what
        combinations of activities worked best together…the ideal length of
        class… the ideal number of classes… the ideal frequency of classes. For
        years, I tested every technique and approach I could find… and if there was
        something needed that didn't exist, I created it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, I developed the Story-Key™ Method…the method I have used to
        help thousands Learn Spanish in a Quick, Easy and Enjoyable way. The Fast
        & Fun 8-Week Accelerated Spanish Program is what happened when I put it
        all together. The Student does 3 Different Classes a week, each with its
        own special range of fun Accelerated Learning Activities. Here’s what it
        looks like…

            <p class="text-xl">The Live Class is a 60 minute, action packed, learning adventure with props, music, story-asks, movement, jokes, games, slides, movie-talks, and a range of different Advanced Accelerated Learning Tools. The class is limited to 8 students so that each student can participate fully in every conversation, and the whole class is IN SPANISH. We speak no English and everyone is able to speak Spanish in full sentences with ease right from the start and enjoy every minute of it. This is where we set all of the Learning Anchors and set up the <span class="font-bold">High Frequency Structures</span> that will be activated during this class and the next 2 classes. </p>

            <h2 class="card-title m-auto text-3xl font-accent underline mb-2">The 45 Minute Zoom Booster Class</h2>
            <p class="text-xl">The 2nd Class is a 45 Minute Pre-Recorded Zoom Class that enables the student to double the skill level achieved in the 1st Class with the added flexibility of taking the class at a time that works best. This class links to a range of Learning Anchors and <span class="font-bold">High Frequency Structures</span> that were set up in the LIVE Class. This enables us to achieve the same results in a shorter 45 minute class. Although we are linking to the same themes used in the Live Class, we are using completely new material and extending the skill level much further. This class also prepares the student for the next class and the 3 multisensory activities they will be using to further expand their skills.</p>

            <p class="text-xl">This class takes Flexible Learning to the next level and consists of three 15 minute Mini- Classes in One (15 mins + 15 mins + 15 mins = a total of 45 minutes). Each Mini-Class is a fun multisensory application that can be done on its own or in combination with the other 2 and at the most convenient time. Each Mini-Class pulls a huge collection of words into Long-Term Memory and hooks them to the <span class="font-bold">High Frequency Structures</span> we set up in Class 1 and 2. Each Mini-Class also works together with the other two Mini-Classes to balance the Student’s Spanish Mastery equally over all 4 communication skills: Speaking, Understanding, Reading, and Writing. </p>
