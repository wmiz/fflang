    HOW is this Possible?
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-12">
    The Fast & Fun 8-Week Accelerated Spanish Program gets students
    communicating IN Spanish…IN full sentences right from the start. It trains
    students to be in <span class="underline"
      >THE NATURAL FLOW OF THE CONVERSATION</span
    > rather than getting stuck in their head thinking about words & grammar while
    the conversation leaves them behind.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-12">
    The first surprise is the whole class is literally IN SPANISH…meaning, we
    don’t speak any English and the next Surprise is…there is <span
      class="underline">ZERO STRESS</span
    >. There is Zero Stress because we are too busy
    <span class="underline">PLAYING</span>
    and <span class="underline">LAUGHING</span> and enjoying the childlike
    <span class="underline">WONDER</span>
    and <span class="underline">CURIOSITY</span> of exploring what’s possible.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-12">
    This program is for Homeschooling Moms of pre-teens & teens who have pulled
    their kids out of the Broken School System and are <span
      class="font-bold underline">looking for a Better Way.</span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Virtually every program out there is <span class="underline font-bold">Drill Based</span>. They believe drilling
    endless lists of words and phrases enables the student to memorize the
    language. We use <span class="underline font-bold">Stories</span> instead of Drills and we created a Story
    (Metaphor): "<span class="underline font-bold">The 3 Doors to a Better Way</span>” to explain WHY.
