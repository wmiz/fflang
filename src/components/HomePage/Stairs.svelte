    The Fast & Fun Accelerated 8-Week Spanish Program
  </h2>
  <div class="text-3xl mb-10 px-10">

      The Story-Key™ 3-Class Set is the perfect Frequency of Spaced Repetition.
      One class a week is not enough and doing an hour a day (recommended for
      Conventional Drill Based Learning) is overkill. We have found time and
      time again…3 classes a week is perfect. More than that though…the 3-Class
      set enables us to achieve such a Massive leap in Skill level that this
      week’s ceiling becomes next week’s floor.

      The amount of progress accomplished each week is far more important than
      it seems. Each 3-class set is designed to stretch the student just beyond
      what SEEMS possible to achieve in the space of a week. Then, when we
      repeatedly turn this week’s “Impossible” into next week’s Norm, it
      skyrockets confidence and builds tremendous Self Belief. This creates a
      positive feedback loop where the Greater their Self Belief…the Greater
      their Spanish Skill becomes…and vice versa ad infinitum.

      With this rate of Accelerating Progress, most reach FLOW (Basic Fluency)
      around 4-5 weeks, just after the halfway point. Some reach it a little
      later and some a little earlier...based on natural processing style…and it
      doesn't matter because ALL get there by week 8.

            The Outer Transformation
          </h2>
          <p class="text-2xl">
            The Outer Transformation from Absolute Beginner to FLOW (Basic
            Fluency) in under 8 Weeks is ONLY possible if I give every student
            the 100% Attention needed to make sure they Fully Establish each
            Progressive Mastery Level with EVERY 3-Class set. With only 8
            Students, I can customize my approach to each individual student’s
            personality and learning style. I need to be constantly adjusting a
            range of different factors for each student so that we all progress
            from one Weekly Mastery Level to the next…together.

            The Inner Transformation
          </h2>
          <p class="text-2xl">
            The Inner Transformation is profound when the student turns this
            week’s “Impossible Skill Level” into Next Week’s Norm, especially
            when this experience is repeated week after week. If I go above 8
            students, I cannot make sure EVERY student has accomplished last
            week's “Impossible.” As each student’s confidence continues to grow,
            it is my job to lock-in that growth as a New Normal by noticing the
            expression of their unique character strengths and bring it to their
            attention. This “Strength Spotting” is vital for creating Lasting
            Positive Change.
