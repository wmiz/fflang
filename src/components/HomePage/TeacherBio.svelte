        Hi, I’m Reed! I know exactly what it feels like to be a homeschooling mom because I homeschooled my own kids…I know how frustrating it can be to find an engaging class…a class kids won’t resist…but one that they actually love! So I developed The Story-Key™ Method and the 8-Week Fast & Fun Accelerated Language Program. I built it for moms, just like you, who pulled their kids out of the broken school system and who are looking for a Better Way.
