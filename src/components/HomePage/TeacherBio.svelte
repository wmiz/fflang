        Hi, I’m Reed! I know exactly what it feels like to be a homeschooling mom because I homeschooled my own kids…I know how frustrating it can be to find an engaging class…a class kids won’t resist…but one that they actually love! So I developed The Story-Key™ Method and the 8-Week Fast & Fun Accelerated Language Program. I built it for moms, just like you, who pulled their kids out of the broken school system and who are looking for a Better Way.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        I have been a World Language Teacher for more than 3 decades, but when I was a fresh new teacher, I used to watch movies like Dead Poets Society or Mr. Holland's Opus over and over because I dreamed of being the type of teacher who could make a positive difference in kids’ lives.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Since I’ve been using the Story-Key™ Method, I’ve learned that teaching Spanish is so much more than the transfer of information, or in this case, a skill…speaking fluent Spanish.
      </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Yes, I’m proud of the speed, the ease, and the sheer enjoyment of The Story-Key™ Path to Spanish Fluency…But there was a much bigger benefit (for both the student and for me) that I couldn’t see until after I saw the profound changes to the kids’ overall value for learning, their belief in their capabilities, and their overall Sense of Self.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            The Story-Key™ Method blows out all the limiting beliefs the student received from trying to fit into the broken school system…and replaces them with 3 empowering beliefs…and the enjoyment of learning stacked higher and higher over 24 classes, gradually restoring the child’s Natural Love of Learning, and these 2 together (a change in their values & beliefs) eventually causes a positive shift in IDENTITY.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            The young person believes in themselves at a much deeper level…they also believe in their own capacities, and then they believe in their ability to acquire any skill they want to in life.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            The Story-Key™ Method enabled me to finally become the kind of teacher I always dreamed of being.
