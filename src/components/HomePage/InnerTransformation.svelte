        As a Homeschooling Mom…you are now a Teacher, too. When I was a new
        teacher, I had a Vision of creating a wonderful learning environment. A
        happy, loving environment where kids could not just learn the material,
        but also grow into strong, happy and resilient people. All of the
        homeschooling moms I’ve talked to had the same vision.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Then we ran into a wall…Resistant Kids. How in the world do we get them
        Motivated?
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        We tried everything…Consequences and Rewards…Straightforward
        threats…Bribery…Lecturing them…Pleading with them…Trying to convince
        them in any way we could. It all just made them more resistant. Every
        week, I read the same comments in both teachers and homeschoolers’
        Facebook groups…“I’m ready to quit,” “I’m so tired and burnt out,” “I
        feel like a failure” and “I don’t know what to do.”
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        I feel for every one of them because I felt that way, too.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        I was obsessed with finding a better way of teaching languages and with
        the Story-Key™ Method, I found it. But I also found something I never
        expected. After I had been using the new system for a year or so, I
        realized I had no resistant students. None.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Even more important, I noticed a profound transformation in even the
        kids who were struggling the most when they first started. It was a
        shift in their fundamental well-being and their belief in themselves. It
        was more than just an increase in confidence. This started me on a whole
        new quest to find out what was going on. Here’s what I found…
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Everything we ever want to do in life fits into ALL of these 5 levels,
        but we generally only think in terms of the bottom 3. I was no
        different. I wanted to find the absolute best possible way to transfer
        the skill of speaking Spanish (Level 3). And I found it…20 hours is a
        whole lot better than 600, not to mention the ease of getting it all
        into Long-Term Memory, and doing the whole thing in the best possible
        learning states. But even this is insignificant compared to what I was
        about to discover.

          <p class="mb-2">
            I found the secret to resolving the problem of resistant students
            (Level 2) could not be solved at the same behavioral level. That’s
            why nothing we tried ever worked.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            The Story-Key™ Method caused me to accidentally solve this Level 2
            Behavioral problem from Level 4, Values & Beliefs…the only level
            from which it could be solved.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Let me explain. The key to solving this problem turned out to be the
            exact same key that opens Door #1. Think about what’s
            happening…every class, we are stacking one experience of joyful
            learning on top of another. The feeling states of curiosity &
            surprise roll into states of playfulness & humor, that then roll
            into profound states of moral elevation, followed by more curiosity,
            by more surprise. I didn’t know it at the time, but we were
            collapsing all those negative feelings they had about learning with
            these positive feelings that were getting stronger and stronger with
            every class.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Here’s the kicker! All of those negative beliefs that were being
            glued in place by those negative emotions went away with them.
            Beliefs such as “I hate learning,” “Learning’s hard for me,” “I’m
            slow,” “I’m stupid,” “It’s too hard,” “I’m not smart enough,” “I’m
            not good enough”...they all disappeared because the negativity was
            working like glue to hold them in place.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            They were replaced by 3 empowering beliefs that were simply born out
            of their own repeated experience…class after class. These 3 new
            beliefs were all variations of “I love learning,” “I find learning
            easy,” and “I’m a fast learner.” Each one of these beliefs were
            simply developed from walking through each one of the 3 doors…over
            and over again (Door #1 to more Enjoyable Learning, Door #2 to
            Easier Learning, and Door #3 to Faster Learning).
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            In the process, we’d also restored their Natural Love of Learning
            that the broken school system had almost destroyed. This
            automatically moved their value for learning up to the top of their
            values hierarchy. They didn’t just love learning…they now valued it
            highly and it stayed that way…and I believe it will stay that way
            for the rest of their lives.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Now, when we changed their values and beliefs, everything changed on
            the 3 levels below. It was easy for them to acquire the skill
            because they valued it and believed they could. All the resistance
            and behavioral problems (Level 2) disappeared because they were too
            busy having fun learning. And here’s the best part…that learning
            environment I dreamed of creating as a young teacher was finally a
            reality. But the story doesn’t end there. When we shifted their
            values and beliefs, it didn’t just change the 3 values below it. It
            transformed their Sense of Self (Level 5 - Identity).
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Please understand, they didn’t become a different person. They
            became More of Who they REALLY are…A Child of God. A Unique
            Expression of The Infinite with a Unique Gift inside of them they
            came here to give to this world. And deep down inside, at some
            level, somehow…they knew it.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            My job suddenly became very simple. Continue using the Story-Key™
            Method to blow out their false limiting beliefs and replace them
            with the 3 empowering beliefs as we go through the 8-Week Fast & Fun
            Program. As their Natural Love of Learning gradually becomes
            restored, simply affirm their enjoyment of the learning process. The
            only other thing that I do to speed things along a little bit...is
            something that I call “Strength Spotting.”
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            I’m constantly looking for their unique strengths and when I see
            them, I point them out immediately. This is why I have to limit the
            classes to just 8. I have to give each one of them my constant
            attention.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            You see, I’ve noticed that each kid has a unique combination of 3-5
            top strengths, and if I can find them and point them out repeatedly,
            it’s like a combination lock that unlocks their full potential.
            Together, this combination of top strengths represents their own
            unique preciousness and…it’s that Unique Preciousness that we need
            to draw out of them and into this world. That’s their Unique Gift
            they came here to give.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Towards the end of the program, I send a little note to each student
            that lets them know all of the good qualities I see in them and let
            them know how I believe these unique strengths will enable them to
            have a wonderful life. As I’m writing this, I see so many faces of
            so many kids flash onto the screen of my mind, and I can honestly
            say I love every single one of them…each for their own unique
            preciousness.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-8">
            I thought I was looking for a vehicle that would help me teach
            Spanish in a quicker, easier, and enjoyable way. I found that
            vehicle, but I also found that teaching Spanish is simply a vehicle
            for helping kids learn that they were more than they thought they
            were. When it comes to learning Spanish, The Story-Key™ Method is
            so valuable…But what it enables us to achieve at a level of Values,
            Beliefs and Identity…is literally Priceless.
